# `cell-family`

Cells inspired by [`qcell::TCell`][__link0] / [`qcell::TLCell`][__link1], with additional features.


## Overview

`cell-family` provides the [`define!`][__link2] macro, which defines a new [`Family`][__link3]. For each family, a corresponding [`Cell`][__link4] and [`CellOwner`][__link5] can be created. Only a single [`CellOwner`][__link6] per family can exist at once, but multiple cells can exist at the same time.

For instance, you may define a family `FooFamily` as below:


```rust
cell_family::define!(type FooFamily: FooCellOwner for FooCell<T>);
```

This defines `FooFamily` (which implements [`Family`][__link7]) as well as `FooCellOwner` and `FooCell`, aliases for [`CellOwner<FooFamily>`][__link8] and [`Cell<FooFamily>`][__link9] respectively.

One `FooCellOwner` can exist per thread, and thus `FooCellOwner` is **not** `Send`, since sending a `FooCellOwner` to another thread may allow two `FooCellOwner`s to co-exist in a single thread. To allow a single `FooCellOwner` per program (and thus make `FooCellOwner` `Send`), prefix `define!` with `static`:


```rust
cell_family::define!(static type FooFamily: FooCellOwner for FooCell<T>);
```

For both thread-local and thread-safe families, the API is the same:


```rust
let mut owner = FooCellOwner::new();
let a = FooCell::new(1);
let b = FooCell::new("bar");

assert_eq!(*a.get(&owner), 1);
assert_eq!(*b.get(&owner), "bar");

*a.get_mut(&mut owner) += 1;
*b.get_mut(&mut owner) = "baz";

assert_eq!(*a.get(&owner), 2);
assert_eq!(*b.get(&owner), "baz");
```

 - [`FooCell::new(T)`][__link10] simple wraps `T` in a `#[repr(transparent)]` [`FooCell`][__link11] without performing any checks.
 - [`FooCell::get(&FooCellOwner)`][__link12] and [`FooCell::get_mut(&mut FooCellOwner)`][__link13] are constant-time operations that return `&T` and `&mut T` respectively without performing any runtime checks. Since a single [`FooCellOwner`][__link14] exists per program (or thread), the aliasing rules of each cell is enforced by Rust through the `FooCellOwner`, which is borrowed as long as each `FooCell` is borrowed.
 - `FooFamily` ensures that a single `FooCellOwner` exists within a program; if another `FooCellOwner` exists, [`FooCellOwner::new()`][__link15] will panic. A [`try_new()`][__link16] counterpart exists to avoid crashing in such a case.


## Benefits over [`qcell::TCell`][__link17] / [`qcell::TLCell`][__link18]

 - Unlike [`qcell::TCell`][__link19] (respectively [`qcell::TCell`][__link20]), the `Family` `F` is in charge of ensuring that a single `CellOwner<F>` exists per program (respectively thread). By using macros to generate families, we only need a single [`AtomicBool`][__link21] (respectively [`Cell<bool>`][__link22]) for each family, thus requiring no allocations.
 - A few additional methods are provided; for instance, [`owner.get(c)`][__link23], [`owner.get_mut(c)`][__link24] and [`owner.try_get_mut(c)`][__link25] are provided, where `c` can be:
	 - A tuple of [`Cell`][__link26]s.
	 - An array of [`Cell`][__link27]s.
	 - An array of references to [`Cell`][__link28]s.
	 - A slice of [`Cell`][__link29]s.
	
	
 - Thread-local and thread-safe [`Cell`][__link30]s (and [`CellOwner`][__link31]s) are backed by the same type; whether they are thread-local or thread-safe is determined by their [`Family`][__link32]: if it is thread-safe, it will also implement [`ThreadSafeFamily`][__link33]. This makes it easier to define generic functions over `Cell`s.
 - `cell-family` fully supports `#[no_std]`, **except** for thread-local families in non-`nightly` builds (since thread-local variables cannot be defined in `#[no_std]` without `#[thread_local]`, which is not stable).
 - `Cell` is [`Debug`][__link34], and will print a representation of its inner value if no `CellOwner` currently exists.
